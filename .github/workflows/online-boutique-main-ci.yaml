  # There's no point to run unit tests again after PR merge
  # Unit testing deals with changes for the affected components,
  #   and that it is already taken care in the PR workflow

  # What it makes sense, is to run integration tests,
  #   to see if the whole application is impacted after merging the changes
  #
  # Run deployment tests (integration tests)
  # Please bear in mind that more tests means increased workflow run time
  # With workflow concurrency disabled, means more waiting time for other PRs in the queue
